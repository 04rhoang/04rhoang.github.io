# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Richard Hoang and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    After a long year of learning code, lab 5, part 3, was one of my favorites as it opened my eyes to how games were coded, especially with a well-known game like BlackJack. Understanding how the functions understand what each card means enlightens me to know the behind-the-scenes of how a compiler computes any Blackjack hand overall. Even if the value was not a number, the way we could convince the machine to know that the Jack, Queen, King, or Ace was a card that held a value was eye-opening.

* Lab 3

    Though elementary now, when looking back at it, lab 3, part 1, was charming as a step forward in this unfamiliar world. How we could control a function to delegate topics to each category and determine how to set statements that return to the end user was mind-boggling. Furthermore, it ensured me that coding was not too complicated when I applied myself and continued on this computer science journey. Overall this lab provided the back support I needed to complete all other labs, not only for the information but its skills.

* Lab 9

    Lastly, another of my favorite ones was lab 9, part 2. It was a mix of logic and modernness where I got to understand the different levels of abstraction in misspelling and, more importantly, validating dictionary file lists. In this case, it allowed me to evaluate what auto-correct might be like on a simplistic level and more so for computer file documentation. This lab ensured that I could develop an understanding of computer calculations more than logic in math and prove to all that the input of misspelled words could be solved with a bit of work.
